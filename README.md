# Funky-christmas-light
The ChristmasLights application is a fun project to create
a mesmerizing light display. This simple app contains seven colored circles
in a row and based on a timer change the intensity of each circle. When
a circle is brightened it's predecessor returns to its normal intensity.

This simulates the effect of a string of rippling lights, similar to the ones
displayed during the Christmas Holidays.
Wishing you a *Merry Christmas and* A prosperous new **Year**!!
